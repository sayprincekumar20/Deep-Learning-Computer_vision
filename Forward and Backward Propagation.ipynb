    "**Forward propagation** is the process by which input data is passed through the layers of a neural network to produce an output. It is a key phase in the working of a neural network, where the network makes predictions based on the given input. Forward propagation involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Input Layer**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The process starts with the **input layer**, where the data (e.g., an image, text, or any other input) is fed into the network.\n",
    "- Each input feature corresponds to a node in the input layer.\n",
    "- In this layer, the input data is not modified or processed; it simply enters the network and moves to the next layer.\n",

    "\n",
    "- After the input layer, the data moves to the **first hidden layer**.\n",
    "- Each neuron in the hidden layer computes a **weighted sum** of the inputs it receives. This is achieved by multiplying each input by its corresponding **weight** and adding a **bias**.\n",

    "# Purpose of the Activation Function in Forward Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "The **activation function** plays a critical role in the forward propagation of a neural network by introducing **non-linearity** into the model. Here's an in-depth look at its purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Introducing Non-linearity**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Without activation functions, a neural network would be a series of linear transformations, which would mean that no matter how many layers the network has, it would behave like a single-layer linear model.\n",
    "- **Activation functions introduce non-linearity**, allowing the network to learn and approximate complex patterns, relationships, and functions.\n",
    "- Non-linearity enables the network to model complex tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and more, which would be impossible for a purely linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is non-linearity important?\n",
    "- Most real-world data (e.g., images, speech, text) are non-linear. If we use only linear transformations, no matter how many layers we add, the network would still be limited to linear approximations of the data.\n",
    "- **Non-linearity** in the activation function enables the network to learn complex patterns by combining the outputs of multiple neurons in a non-linear way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Enabling Complex Decision Boundaries**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Activation functions help the network create **complex decision boundaries**. \n",
    "- For instance, in a classification problem, a neural network with non-linear activation functions can separate classes in a non-linear manner, improving the network's ability to perform classification on more complicated datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Control Over the Output Range**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Activation functions often control the **output range** of a neuron, shaping the network's response to inputs.\n",
    "  - For example, the **sigmoid** function squashes its input to a range between 0 and 1, which is useful for binary classification.\n",
    "  - The **tanh** function squashes the input to a range between -1 and 1, making it suitable for data that can be both positive and negative.\n",
    "  - The **ReLU** function outputs the input directly if it's positive, and zero if it's negative, which is effective in avoiding problems like vanishing gradients during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. **Preventing Vanishing/Exploding Gradients (in specific cases)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some activation functions like **ReLU** help mitigate the issue of vanishing gradients that can occur in deep networks. Without proper activation functions, gradients could become too small during backpropagation, making it hard for the network to learn.\n",
    "- Activation functions like **ReLU** prevent gradients from vanishing by providing a direct path for gradients to flow through the network during backpropagation.\n",

    "- In forward propagation, the activation function’s output is used to compute the error or loss during the backward propagation phase.\n",

    "**1. Sigmoid Activation Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sigmoid function maps values to a range between 0 and 1, which is useful for binary classification problems.\n",
    "- The sigmoid_derivative function is defined for potential use in backpropagation, although we won't use it here for forward propagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Network Initialization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We initialize the network with random weights for both the input-to-hidden layer and hidden-to-output layer. The biases for both layers are also randomly initialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Forward Propagation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The input data X (shape: 4 samples, 2 features) is passed through the network.\n",
    "- The hidden layer input is calculated by taking the dot product of X with the weights connecting the input layer to the hidden layer and adding the bias term.\n",
    "- The hidden layer output is obtained by applying the sigmoid activation function to the hidden layer input.\n",
    "- The output layer input is calculated by taking the dot product of the hidden layer output with the weights connecting the hidden layer to the output layer and adding the bias term.\n",
    "- The output layer output is obtained by applying the sigmoid activation function to the output layer input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The final outputs of the network after forward propagation are printed."
